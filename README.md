opensprinkler_bbb_io
====================

Modified gpio_pins file for OpenSprinkler BBB to directly drive pins instead of using 74HC595

This was written in ten minutes to get my sprinklers running before i left on holiday, and yes it should be half the size!

I'll try and remove the extra code late next week.
